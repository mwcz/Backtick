**Backtick is a console for bookmarklets and scripts**, packaged as a Chrome extension. For a better explanation, try out the demo at [backtick.io/](http://backtick.io). The extension is free to use, but it will occasionally nag you to install the [$5 Backtick license](http://goo.gl/LkPHMG).

#### Developing
If you want to play around with the code, you'll want to install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) first. With that installed,
just run `grunt build` to compile everything. You'll then want to import the `dist` folder as an unpacked extension in Chrome.

#### Why are you open sourcing this?
Because that's just something I like to do to contribute back to the community. It also forces me to write cleaner code. (Well, in theory at least)

#### Support the author!
This fork has the license nag disabled, but you, dashing and brilliant patriot that you are, will leap at the opportunity to [support the author](http://goo.gl/LkPHMG) and support continued development.
